# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Your Task

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

-  able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- enter the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
-  open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia would successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
